    AI Statement Reviewer App

    This application uses OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude language models, along with the LangChain framework, to provide an AI-driven statement review service for students applying to universities. 

    The app reviews student personal statements and gives feedback on several aspects:
    1. Grammar and Structure: The app evaluates the grammar and structural integrity of the personal statement, providing suggestions for improvement where necessary.
    2. Tips and Recommendations: The app gives personalized tips and recommendations, encouraging students to engage in their own research and further study.

    The application is designed to democratize access to high-quality personal statement advice, providing feedback that was previously only available to a select few. The ultimate goal is to enhance social mobility and level the playing field for all students, regardless of their background.

    This application is a part of Afinity.io's suite of student advice services, which aim to provide comprehensive guidance to students choosing courses at the university level. It is also an important step towards Afinity.io's vision for 2030: to have every student make informed study choices through the Afinity platform.
